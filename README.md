# EARTHBOUND TRAVELER

+Program to calculate distances across the globe using the Haversine formula. Sorry all you Flat-Earthers out there! 

    - User gives names of two cities

    - Program gets the londitudeand latitude of each

    - Program then calculates the distance in Miles using the Haversine formula.



### The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles.

　
Now the program calculates and displays how long it would take to get there using different modes of travel:


  - Walking at speed 3 mph


  - Biking at speed 12 mph


  - Driving a car at avg speed of 55mph


  - Flying in a commercial plane at speed 575 mph


  - Flying in a rocket at speed 17,000 mph
