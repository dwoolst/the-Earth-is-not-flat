    2) Biking
    3) Driving a Car
    4) Taking a Commercial Jet
    5) Riding in a Rocket

Walking there would take 1 month, 2 days, 1 hour, 50 minutes, 43 seconds.
Provided you have a pair of comfortable shoes.

--------------------------------------------------
Pedaling a bike would take 1 week, 1 day, 2 hours, 57 minutes, 40 seconds.
But only if you have very sturdy tires.
--------------------------------------------------

Including a magical freeway for those over-the-water parts.

Flying in a commercial jet would take 4 hours, 4 minutes, 7 seconds.
Ignoring the wait at security of course.

With Elon Musks permission.. Good luck with that.

Fun Factoid:
Walking all the way around the circumference of the Earth(24,901 miles) would take 11 months, 1 week, 4 days, 6 hours, 20 minutes.
Provided you are entirely insane.
